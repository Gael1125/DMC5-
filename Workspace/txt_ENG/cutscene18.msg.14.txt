<string>
<string>Ya got some pretty big cojones for comin' back.
<string>Just don't know when to give up, do ya!?
<string>Get out of my way, Nero!
<string>Defeating you like this has no meaning.
<string>C'mon, Vergil. Let's do this!
<string>Heal your wounds, Dante. Get strong.
<string>After that, we'll settle the matter.
<string>Thank you, Nero.
<string>Dammit!
<string>If that's your brother, what happened to V?
<string>He returned...
<string>to himself.
<string>Go home, Nero. This doesn't concern you.
<string>Like hell! I lost my right arm because of him!
<string>This is not your fight. I need to stop him,<lf>and that's all that matters.
<string>
<string>I'm not gonna let you have all the fun, Dante!
<string>You don't get it!
<string>Lemme guess, I'm dead weight? You can shove that—
<string>That's not it, Nero.
<string>What is it, then!?
<string>He's your father!
<string>What!?
<string>I had the feeling, the first time<lf>I saw you, but I just wasn't sure.
<string>And then I saw how the Yamato reacted...and I was certain.
<string>He's your father.
<string>Now, he needs an ass-kicking...
<string>But I can't have you go kill your old man.
<string>My father...?
<string>
<string>That day, if our positions were switched...
<string>Would our fates be different?
<string>Would I have your life, and you mine?
<string>Let's settle this...
<string>Dante.
<string>
<string>What? What's happening now!?
<string>Oh God, I thought it was over!
<string>This isn't good. We're gonna get dragged into this!
<string>Dante! What happened?
<string>My dumbass brother's back, and I'm gonna rip him a new one.
<string>Vergil's—? How!?
<string>Dante!
<string>Made it for Lady and she paid for it,<lf>so consider it a rental.
<string>Hey, you can't just—!
<string>Okay, okay, we'll take care of that later. Right now,<lf>you three get the hell out of here.
<string>I'm gonna go take care of old douchebag.
<string>Got a feeling this one's gonna be a doozy.
<string>
<string>Hey, guys where ya been? I thought you went<lf>back into Vergil.
<string>You're gonna wish you did.
<string>
<string>Oh, the wise guy Dante.
<string>We were spawned from Vergil's abominable<lf>thoughts. But you knew that already...
<string>Come to think of it, I did know somethin' was off.
<string>Just like with my old brother.
<string>
<string>Well, we're merely the discarded thoughts from when<lf>he was Nelo Angelo. No longer bound in his consciousness.
<string>
<string>We're here now to kill you of our own free will.
<string>Liberating!
<string>And kill you we shall, Dante. Us, not Vergil.
<string>
<string>Should'a known better. You got a good heart,<lf>but you're about as sharp as marble.
<string>
<string>Perhaps...
<string>But if you had even a little bit of trouble<lf>defeating us, imagine what Vergil can do to you.
<string>Go see for yourself.
<string>Us? This is our final flight...
<string>And the end of Vergil's nightmares.
<string>Godspeed, Dante... You'll need it.
<string>Rest in peace, little chicken.
<string>It's been a bash.
<string>
<string>Nero, jump in!
<string>Where's Dante!?
<string>He's got this. We gotta go, now!
<string>So this guy Vergil, you know him?
<string>Vaguely, yes.
<string>Dante said that guy's my father...<lf>What the hell's going on, Trish!?
<string>
<string>His logic is sound... I had a hunch myself.
<string>This doesn't make any SENSE!
<string>I know you hate Vergil, but you<lf>can't kill your own father.
<string>
<string>It's true. You'd never recover from that.
<string>You saved us, you should be proud.<lf>Now you can put all this behind you—
<string>
<string>Nico! Stop the car!
<string>No chance! After all this, are you insane!?
<string>Fine, I'll go by myself!
<string>
<string>Nero!
