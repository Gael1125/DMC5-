<string>Hoo-wee. I'm still in friggin' shock...
<string>About what?
<string>Uhh, duh! Your arm?
<string>Who the hell grows an arm back, it's just weird.
<string>It's like a...lizard tail, or something?
<string>Look, I don't know, it just grew. I mean, are<lf>you kiddin' me? Lots of weird stuff happened.
<string>There were demons and scary plant roots,<lf>and arms growin' back. Lots of stuff.
<string>Do you know how much love and care<lf>I put in that Devil Breaker?
<string>Nope.
<string>But this arm, it's nice.
<string>So, uh, how's it feel?
<string>How's what feel?
<string>Saving the man who killed your own father.
<string>Heard Dante killed Vergil once.
<string>Doesn't matter. They're both gone now anyway.
<string>It's okay to cry if you want, Nero, over a loss.
<string>I'm not crying.
<string>It doesn't make you a crybaby. Does make you a little bitch though.
<string>There it is.
<string>You think I'm a demon?
<string>I didn't cry when my asshole daddy died.
<string>But...
<string>Yeah, I know, I know.
<string>I wouldn't be here without him, that's a biological fact.
<string>Right.
<string>All I'm saying is, tough guy...it's okay to cry if you want.
<string>— Devils cry.
<string>— I'm not crying.
<string>Devils cry!
<string>I'm not gonna cry.
<string>— Kittens cry "meow," puppies cry "woof!"
<string>— Will you shut up? Will you stop it?
<string>— Why don't you cry on my shoulder.
<string>— Look at you. You're—nobody's crying, all right?
<string>— Come on, cry on my shoulder! I know you wanna.
<string>— Stop saying cry. If you say cry again―
<string>Devil May Cry—@#$!
<string>You said it.
<string>Hey, Kyrie.
<string>...Yeah, I'm comin' home.
<string>Oh yeah, I don't wanna spoil it<lf>but I've got a surprise for you.
<string>Oh yeah, he's got a HUGE surprise.
<string>Will you shut up!?
<string>No no no no, Kyrie, not you. Nico, you know,<lf>and her big mouth. We're just—
<string>
<string>What the hell's your problem!?<lf>Where'd you learn to drive!?
<string>Hey, uh...sorry, I gotta call ya later.
<string>It's time to get back to work.
<string>Got an arm, I'm good.
<string>It's a prototype. And this is the perfect place to<lf>test it out! Look, you're gonna use it, and—
<string>"It's a work of ART!"
<string>I gotcha.
<string>...and it ain't complete without you.
<string>Well, how sweet...
<string>Feels good!
<string>You'll get fixed as soon as we get back!
<string>So...devils cry, huh?
<string>Let's hear what that SOUNDS LIKE!
<string>
<string>Guess that's the end, then.
<string>
<string>So, all we gotta do is cut this thing down?
<string>That's right.
<string>I'm more than capable of handling this on my own.
<string>You're gonna need some help...<lf>And someone to keep an eye on you.
<string>
<string>
<string>Wow, no sign of him. Nothing.
<string>Mmm... Yeah.
<string>Then, can I have this office? Because I've been thinking<lf>it's almost time for me to settle down somewhere.
<string>
<string>No, I don't think so. I rather quite like it.
<string>Oh, I hate to spoil your dreams, ladies,<lf>but that shit ain't gonna happen.
<string>Whattaya mean, Morrison?
<string>See, there's this deed to this place, and I have it.
<string>Why do you—?
<string>Clever little devil came to see me right before his last job.
<string>Said something like, "My dearest friend, I know<lf>you'll keep this safe, 'cause them crazy bitches—"
<string>Did I say crazy bitches? I'm sorry, I meant ladies.
<string>Anyway, the rest of the story is not<lf>important, you get the gist.
<string>I wonder if he even plans on coming back.
<string>Got me.
<string>What is important is I have a job for you two.
<string>...'Cause the rent ain't free.
<string>
<string>Score for Dante! I'm up one.
<string>Where did you learn to count!? We're even.
<string>You know...
<string>I'm starting to think this is never gonna end.
<string>Maybe.
<string>We got plenty of time.
<string>Don't you dare say it—!
<string>
<string>Jackpot!
<string>
