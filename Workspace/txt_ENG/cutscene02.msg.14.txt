<string>That's it. No more wheels from here.
<string>All right. Guess I'm walkin', then.
<string>Yo yo yo, check it out.
<string>What?
<string>And this is?
<string>From Morrison. I think it's his manifesto.
<string>
<string>Hey, we doin' this or what?
<string>I'm waitin' on you.
<string>I'm cookin'. Any special orders?
<string>
<string>Huh... Looks like I'm gonna make it<lf>there before you do, V.
<string>
<string>Somebody call a doctor?
<string>Human... I wasn't expecting any survivors!
<string>Sorry to disappoint ya...
<string>Hey, ya happen to see a guy around here,<lf>about this big, uses a cane?
<string>
<string>I'm supposed to meet him. Did you snack on him?
<string>Your blood...is a very precious sacrifice...<lf>Eating you would do me no good.
<string>I must have every last drop...<lf>to rule the Underworld...as king!
<string>King? You?
<string>I don't know. I mean, you're a big guy and all,
<string>but you seem more like a knuckle-scrapping<lf>fart in the wind than anything else.
<string>No offense.
<string>Puny human... Do you know who I am?
<string>I shall show you...the wrath...of the mighty Goliath!!!
<string>Cool trick! Hey, do you do parties?
<string>
<string>I must not be defeated...in a place like this.
<string>The fruit...is mine...<lf>I will rule the Underworld, not him...!
<string>"I curse my stars in bitter grief and woe,
<string>That made my love so high and me, so low."
<string>Why... Why are you...?
<string>"Little wanderer,"
<string>"hie thee home!"
<string>Thought I was gonna have to<lf>pick you out of his...tummy teeth.
<string>Pardon my delay, I was catching up on some reading.
<string>Yeah... Looks like a real page-turner.
<string>So... You think Dante's still in there?
<string>If Urizen defeated him, then I expect he's<lf>not much more than Qliphoth pollen by now.
<string>A what...?
<string>Qliphoth. It's a tree that grows in the underworld.
<string>It thrives on human blood, and<lf>those whose blood it sucks, well...
<string>...Let's just say they don't turn out too well.
<string>Well, in any case...we need to find out.
<string>If Dante's alive, we'll save him. If not, we don't.
<string>Wait.
<string>First, we need to exterminate some Qliphoth roots.
<string>V...
<string>What the hell are you?
<string>I know, I know, I'm late. Shut it!
<string>The roads were all clogged.
<string>Hey, you must be V, huh?
<string>Hey, you gonna get that?
<string>Ding ding ding, right by your feet!
<string>I'm gonna make something amaaazing out of this.
<string>Did you just sniff that?
<string>Do you have any idea where that's been?
<string>Up your butt?
<string>Focus on the mission.
