<string>The Qliphoth is said to be the tree of<lf>life that resides in the demon world.<lf>It is the source of all life and gathers<lf>human blood—the source of demonic<lf>power. Once every several thousand<lf>years, the tree bears fruit made of<lf>this condensed blood.<lf><lf>Whoever should eat the fruit gains<lf>sovereign power to rule over all. Trish<lf>told of a demon named Mundus, who<lf>consumed one of these fruits to become<lf>the king of the underworld. The Qliphoth<lf>never bore fruit again after Mundus, as<lf>Sparda separated the worlds of demon<lf>and man.<lf><lf>But now, the border between these worlds<lf>is no more, and the Qliphoth is sure to<lf>bear fruit once again. I dare say the tree<lf>has appeared on the surface for this very<lf>reason.<lf><lf>The laws of the underworld differ from<lf>ours... Unlike the trees of our world, the<lf>Qliphoth grows from the surface to the<lf>deep underground. If you wish to reach<lf>the point where the fruit grows, you<lf>must head straight down.<lf><lf>And I doubt you need me to tell you what<lf>manner of abomination waits below...
<string>A large number of citizens were cut down<lf>in the heart of Red Grave City on the<lf>evening of the 16th. The exact number of<lf>victims is currently unknown, and the<lf>perpetrator is still at large. The police<lf>have cordoned off roads in the vicinity.<lf>An investigation is currently underway,<lf>as is the search for the criminal.<lf><lf>----------------------------------------<lf>----------------------------------------<lf><lf>Authorities have reported that the victims<lf>of the Red Grave City massacre now number<lf>in the hundreds. The remains of the dead<lf>are horribly disfigured, with only pieces<lf>of some victims being recovered.<lf><lf>Although bodies have yet to be found, a<lf>large number of citizens have gone missing<lf>since the incident. The police are trying<lf>to piece together the events of that night<lf>from the scant few survivors, and are<lf>hurriedly reviewing all of the damage.<lf><lf>--------------------------------------------------<lf>--------------------------------------------------<lf><lf>Police reported that the corpse of a woman<lf>was discovered in the charred remains of<lf>a residence that had gone up in flames on<lf>the night of the incident.<lf><lf>The woman is thought to have been the owner<lf>of the residence, but evidence to substantiate<lf>this claim is currently lacking. According to<lf>testimony from other survivors, a pair of<lf>twins also lived with the woman, but<lf>their remains have yet to be found.
<string>I often think of that boy as of late.<lf>Wise beyond his scant years...<lf><lf>He would show up at my home with his nose<lf>crammed into some collection of poems. He<lf>seemed to favor William Blake most of all,<lf>so one day I gave him a Blake anthology as<lf>a present. With an expression of delight<lf>on his face, he asked to borrow a pen.<lf><lf>Strange though I found the request, I gave<lf>him the pen on my person. The boy opened<lf>the back cover, and proceeded to scribble<lf>his own name within.<lf><lf>I was puzzled to see him write on the book<lf>in such a way, and asked the lad what had<lf>possessed him to do such a thing.<lf>Clutching the anthology to his chest,<lf>he answered thusly:<lf><lf>"I have a twin brother, sir. We fight over<lf>things often, so I have to write my<lf>name on things to make them truly mine."<lf><lf>I found myself charmed by his statement,<lf>and at once envious of such purity. I felt<lf>ashamed...me, a self-styled bibliophile,<lf>had devoted himself solely to preserving<lf>the beauty of books...<lf><lf>It was clear that this child loved books far<lf>more than I ever did.<lf><lf>That child is no longer in this town. He<lf>disappeared amidst circumstances most<lf>unsavory. Perhaps he is no longer in this<lf>world. To think that a promising youth<lf>like that could lose his life, while a<lf>lout like me still drags on...<lf>The thought is almost unbearable.<lf><lf>I am already in my twilight years...<lf>Perhaps that is why I recall that youth's<lf>serene eyes at every opportunity...<lf>That pure, untainted youth.
<string>This is all of the info I've gathered in<lf>my investigation of the Red Grave City<lf>incident. If the truth is brought to<lf>light, this would be bigger than revealing<lf>who Jack the Ripper was... Hell, this<lf>could rock the world as we know it.<lf><lf>But I'm no spring chicken anymore...<lf>My body won't move as I tell it to. I'm<lf>basically bedridden and waiting for death.<lf>No way I can continue my investigation<lf>like this.<lf><lf>Whoever reads this note, I beg you: finish<lf>what I started. You have to find the truth<lf>hidden behind that gruesome tragedy.<lf><lf>One last thing: a young boy apparently<lf>survived the incident. His name was Dante.<lf>No last name, no nothing. All I could find<lf>in my investigation was the fact that he<lf>lived in Red Grave at the time of the<lf>incident. When I tried digging into it,<lf>he refused to acknowledge anything. On<lf>the contrary: he warned me not to poke<lf>any further into the events in question.<lf><lf>Not exactly something you'd say if you had<lf>nothing to do with it... In fact, I'd say<lf>he might know just what kind of monster<lf>could slaughter 136 citizens of that poor<lf>town in under an hour.<lf><lf>If you're reading this note, know that the<lf>boy is one of the few people who knows<lf>just what happened that night. You need to<lf>go and get him to tell you everything. I<lf>have no money, no influence...hell, I<lf>don't even have any friends to speak of.<lf>This request is all I have left.
<string>The world of demons was once connected<lf>to the world of man. The one who ruled<lf>the demon world set his sights on<lf>conquest of the human world. However,<lf>one demon rose up against the demon<lf>king, and fought to protect mankind:<lf>The Dark Knight Sparda.<lf><lf>Wielding a massive sword that shared his<lf>name, Sparda laid the demon king to<lf>rest, along with his subordinates. He<lf>then sealed the gate connecting both<lf>worlds, using a sword as the key. While<lf>most records offer little to no details<lf>about this weapon, many speculate it to<lf>be the Sword of Sparda.<lf><lf>And yet, the following was written in a<lf>record of devil swords I discovered:<lf><lf>"The Dark Knight Sparda split his power<lf>in three parts. One blade bore his own<lf>name; the second blade was named to<lf>embody retaliation; the final blade was<lf>named to embody a god of death."<lf><lf>If this is true, then there are two<lf>other devil swords out there besides<lf>Sparda.<lf><lf>Sparda was sealed by the dark knight<lf>himself, but no one has found any<lf>documents pertaining to the locations of<lf>the other two blades...
<string>Still, when it comes to crafting beautiful<lf>guns, Nell Goldstein is the only one who<lf>can be called a master.<lf><lf>Nell's weapons are works of art.<lf>They are not adorned with unnecessary<lf>ornamentation, nor do they sacrifice<lf>functionality for form. Rather, Nell's creations<lf>are honest, pure pieces with simple and<lf>elegant designs.<lf><lf>This is the beauty that Nell puts into her<lf>craft. Her obsession was .45 caliber<lf>weapons, and she crafted all sorts of<lf>new designs, earning her the<lf>nickname, the .45 Caliber Virtuoso.<lf><lf>Unfortunately, Nell Goldstein lost her life<lf>in an unfortunate accident a few years<lf>ago. She left behind a daughter,<lf>though the two were estranged at the<lf>time of Nell's passing. More than a few<lf>gun enthusiasts—this author included—<lf>must be hoping that Nell's daughter inherited<lf>her mother's techniques...
<string>The town of Fortuna is surrounded by high<lf>ramparts, and it has been cut off from the<lf>outside world for many years. Perhaps<lf>this is the reason for the anachronistic,<lf>almost medieval atmosphere within the<lf>city walls.<lf><lf>The town is governed by a religious<lf>organization known as the Order of the<lf>Sword. 99% of the population are<lf>devotees.<lf><lf>The Order deifies the Dark Knight Sparda,<lf>a being spoken of in various myths around<lf>the world, and worships him as their god.<lf>Legend tells of Sparda ruling Fortuna as a<lf>feudal lord some time in the country's<lf>history.<lf><lf>There was once a massive structure in<lf>Fortuna that the Order worshipped as a<lf>"gate" of sorts, but it collapsed years<lf>ago as the result of an earthquake.<lf>The citizens work to clear away debris<lf>from the incident even today.<lf><lf>Some fancy that earthquake to be the act<lf>of demons, or divine punishment for the<lf>worship of a false god. But in the end,<lf>such talk is simply idle gossip.<lf><lf>Still, the truth is that the earthquake<lf>led to the demise of the Order's top<lf>echelon. The organization is now an<lf>autonomous group without a leader,<lf>and has shrunk significantly in size.
