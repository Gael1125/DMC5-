<string>It's been a good 30 years since I last<lf>wrote something like a letter. Don't<lf>have a typewriter or nothing, so<lf>unfortunately you're stuck with my<lf>shitty handwriting for now.<lf><lf>I heard you're heading back to Red Grave.<lf>Wasn't sure exactly what I could do for<lf>you... I'm not a powerhouse like you, or<lf>the sharpest knife in the drawer.<lf><lf>Still, given my business, the least<lf>I can do is get you a few leads.<lf>Can't say exactly how useful they'll<lf>be to you, but hey...gotta be better<lf>than nothing, right?<lf><lf>So the first time I met Dante, he<lf>actually went by a different name:<lf>Tony Redgrave.<lf><lf>Bet that got your attention, huh?<lf>Tony Redgrave... Red Grave City...<lf>Just a coincidence? Or something more?<lf>I honestly can't say.<lf><lf>Still, figured if you're heading in that<lf>direction you might be able to learn<lf>the truth yourself. That's why I've<lf>decided to tell you everything about<lf>the Dante I know.<lf><lf>It ain't every day that I just give this<lf>stuff away, boy. You'd best be grateful.
<string>Back when Dante went by Tony Redgrave,<lf>there was this place: Bobby's Cellar...<lf>A dive infested with bounty hunters,<lf>would-be soldiers of fortune, and,<lf>often enough, our old pal Tony.<lf>He'd show up from time to time like any of<lf>the other punks and low-lifes looking to<lf>make a quick buck. That's the kind of place<lf>Bobby's Cellar was.<lf><lf>There were plenty of guys like me around,<lf>too. Every one of us knew to make the<lf>rounds to these joints and peddle<lf>our information like precious gems.<lf>Most importantly, getting those jobs<lf>covered kept the cash flowing in.<lf>You better believe ol' Tony made me<lf>a pretty penny.<lf><lf>Still, that guy was always broke as a<lf>bottle of wine. He'd end up busting his<lf>guns on every job. Sure, it all makes<lf>sense now, but at the time I was dumb-<lf>founded. I'd ask myself, what kind of<lf>shots is this guy packing to break a pair<lf>of pistols on every single job?<lf><lf>This old gunsmith in the neighborhood<lf>was always giving him an earful. "Normal<lf>pieces must be like a pair of pop guns to<lf>a guy like you, huh, Tony?" Eventually he<lf>got wise that he'd never make a solid<lf>payday at this rate, so he got the old lady<lf>to design a pair of pistols just for him.<lf><lf>You guessed it...she ending up introducing<lf>Dante to his old pals, Ebony & Ivory.<lf>But wouldn't you know it, she died just as<lf>soon as the job was finished.<lf><lf>Well, more like she was killed. I never<lf>figured out who did it, either—I was out<lf>of town on a big job myself at the time,<lf>you see. But Tony...no, Dante. He knew,<lf>from the sound of it. One of the toughs<lf>from his regular haunt said that after<lf>she passed, he went off somewhere with<lf>the most crestfallen look he'd ever seen.<lf><lf>That's the last anyone would ever see of<lf>Tony Redgrave at Bobby's Cellar.
<string>Before long I got wind that ol' Tony had<lf>opened a little racket of his own...<lf><lf>Devil May Cry.<lf><lf>I managed to track it down,<lf>and walked in to find a man by the name<lf>of Dante...said that'd been his real name<lf>all along.<lf><lf>That was the start of a beautiful<lf>friendship, let me tell you. I'd never<lf>believed in demons or anything like<lf>that, but hanging around that guy<lf>long enough is a goddamned<lf>eye-opener, that's for sure.<lf><lf>Met Lady around the same time. Dante<lf>always played fast and loose with his<lf>money, y'see. I'd see her toss a few<lf>bones his way sometimes, even a job<lf>or two (griping about it the whole time,<lf>of course). The way they carried on, you<lf>could tell they shared some kind of past.<lf><lf>Nothing romantic or some nonsense like<lf>that. No, it's more like...they got what<lf>the other had been through. I tried the<lf>roundabout route to figure it out, but<lf>those two dodge questions the way they<lf>dodge bullets. The past isn't something<lf>they bring up lightly.<lf><lf>One time, Lady let something slip about<lf>"cutting ties that bind." She was on a<lf>pretty heavy bender...mentioned something<lf>about them each having killed family.<lf>Dante, his brother...and Lady, her father.<lf><lf>Can't say for sure if that's the whole<lf>story. I suppose I could look into it...<lf>it is my line of business, after all.<lf>But I'm not the kind of scum to drudge<lf>up a friend's past just to sate my own<lf>curiosity. So I just chalk it up to the<lf>drink...a bunch of booze-induced<lf>nonsense, as far as I'm concerned.
<string>A few years went by, and Dante went off to<lf>an island—something about a case this pretty<lf>young thing brought in. Seems the demon king<lf>was trying to break a seal to get into our world<lf>and she wanted Dante to stop him...<lf><lf>So off our boy went, on a ship to Mallet<lf>Island I'd chartered for him. And the<lf>pretty young thing that went with him?<lf>That was Trish. I gotta say, I was taken<lf>aback when I first laid eyes on her...a dead<lf>ringer for Dante's late mother. I'd never met<lf>the woman—but can you believe the guy<lf>used to have a framed photo of her on his<lf>desk? Bet you'd never have guessed that one.<lf><lf>Anyway, it was only later that I learned of<lf>Trish's true, demonic nature. She was to<lf>lure Dante to his death on Mallet Island;<lf>a sad creature created for the birth of<lf>the demon king. The photo on Dante's<lf>desk was common knowledge at the<lf>time. I guess the demon king wanted to<lf>take advantage of his filial affection.<lf><lf>All sorts of things went down on that<lf>island... Dante took out the demon king<lf>once and for all and came back to Devil<lf>May Cry with Trish in tow. I don't know<lf>the details of what transpired out there...<lf>prying into such matters is unbecoming<lf>of one in my position.<lf><lf>Besides, the important thing is that back<lf>then, Dante defeated the ruler of the<lf>demon world. And this time around,<lf>when V showed up, guess what task<lf>he had for our boy Dante?<lf><lf>"Defeat the resurrected Demon King..."<lf><lf>So Dante took the case, and hoofed it to<lf>Red Grave City.<lf><lf>Is the "demon king" waiting for him there<lf>the same one from Mallet Island? Your<lf>guess is as good as mine. Still, I can't<lf>shake the feeling that this whole thing is<lf>connected to Dante's roots somehow. After<lf>all, this is THE "Tony Redgrave" we're<lf>talking about here...<lf><lf>And there you have it: the whole kit and<lf>caboodle. If I learn anything new I'll be<lf>sure to contact you, so don't go dying<lf>on me before I do. I think I see another<lf>beautiful friendship in the works here,<lf>kid. Don't let me down.
