<string>No hard feelings guys, but this is my gig!
<string>Trust me, Nero... This one's gonna be<lf>a little too much for ya.
<string>
<string>Leave at once!
<string>Only kings of the Underworld may enter these gates!
<string>You shall not pass!
<string>Easy there, fella. Hey...I remember<lf>a stinky little pooch just like you.
<string>You insult me, foul-scented creature!
<string>Looks like your master's got you on a pretty short leash.
<string>Come on, little puppy. I'll take you<lf>out for a walk, c'mon! Let's go!
<string>You have fought our kin in the past...
<string>But I am king of the Cerberus tribe!
<string>They were weak!
<string>But WE will feast on your flesh,
<string>and gnaw on your bones!
<string>So, you're the strongest in the litter.
<string>Looks like we're gonna need a bigger leash. Come on!
<string>
<string>Guess I'm the first one here. I like that!
