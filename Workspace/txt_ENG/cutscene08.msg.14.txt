<string>Guess there's no point thinking about it...
<string>Perfect timing... Now we're startin' to act like a team.
<string>Ew! You, like, flirtin' with me?
<string>Knock it off... Get in the car.
<string>Oh my gawd...
<string>
<string>Well, no point in turnin' back now...
<string>Not that that was ever an option.
<string>Time for some payback.
<string>
<string>Hey douchebag, miss me?
<string>Where's Dante?
<string>No body? No dried up Dante jerky? Nothin'?
<string>You've come here to die?
<string>He talks.
<string>Urizen, huh?
<string>I bet your parents didn't like you much,<lf>'cause your name sucks.
<string>I am without a name.
<string>I am power, absolute.
<string>Well, No Name... I'll be sure to<lf>put that on your tombstone.
<string>You will suffer...
<string>And...die.
<string>
<string>I'll show you dead weight.

<string>Weak mortal.
<string>Demon power does not course through your veins.
<string>Yet, you try...
<string>How dare you strike ME!?
<string>The hell...!?
<string>You will regret...being born useless and human.
<string>I will show you...
<string>your worst nightmares!
<string>I will give you...
<string>despair and death!
<string>
<string>Merely human. Petulant mortal flesh.
<string>Cursed...the moment you were brought into this world.
<string>Who dares interfere?
<string>What creature stands against a king!?
<string>Is that...a demon?
