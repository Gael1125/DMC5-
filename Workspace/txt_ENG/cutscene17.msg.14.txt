<string>The truth is...
<string>I wanted to be protected and loved...
<string>But I was alone. My only choice was to survive.
<string>V, you gotta rest.
<string>Nero...
<string>I will tell you...everything.
<string>There is no demon named Urizen...
<string>Only a man who threw away his humanity,<lf>in an endless pursuit of power.
<string>He is Dante's older brother.
<string>Dante's brother?
<string>Yes. 
<string>And his real name is...
<string>Vergil.
<string>
<string>Vergil...
<string>Hey, is that the damn fruit that you've been<lf>jabberin' about? Doesn't look so special to me.
<string>Yup, this is where it all started.
<string>That day mother saved me and...
<string>left you behind.
<string>The thing you don't know is, she tried to save you, too.<lf>She kept searching and searching...
<string>Until it killed her.
<string>I have no recollection of this tale, or this place.
<string>It's all an illusion, created by this extraordinary fruit.
<string>Its power, you see, is all I ever wanted.
<string>And with this...
<string>I will have everything!
<string>No, brother, you don't have everything.
<string>That last shred of humanity that you still had?
<string>You just lost it!
<string>That is nothing but the pitiful cries<lf>of those without strength.
<string>Come to me, brother...
<string>I shall enlighten you, Dante!
<string>
<string>They're brothers? Why are they fighting each other?
<string>To see one's justice through, a man must fight for it.
<string>Even if the one who stands before him is his kin.
<string>That's ridiculous.
<string>The brothers of blood disagree on the<lf>very reason of their existence. 
<string>They must fight.
<string>Dante!
<string>You're late...just finishing up.
<string>
<string>Is that really your brother?
<string>I'm afraid so.
<string>So he was behind all this. Your own flesh and blood.
<string>Right again.
<string>In the last throes of defeat, I see.
<string>You...
<string>V, get back! Things are about to get really messy.
<string>No! Please...
<string>Let me. 
<string>I want to end this battle...with my own hands.
<string>Do not struggle.
<string>For if you can't even defeat me, then you've already lost.
<string>I will not lose...
<string>Not to Dante...
<string>I need power...
<string>More power!
<string>I know...
<string>We are one and the same, you and I.
<string>But you've lost me, and I've lost you.
<string>Yet we are connected by that one feeling.
<string>"While thy branches mix with mine,<lf>and our roots together join."
<string>What is this?
<string>Vergil...!
