<string>You ready to do this, Vergil? It all ends here!
<string>
<string>This is true power... The power I've sought for so long!
<string>You've been chasing this for an eternity...<lf>and it's nothing but useless shit.
<string>
<string>What's wrong, Vergil? This is no time to hold back.
<string>It would seem so...
<string>
<string>How... How are you so powerful!? You never lost anything!
<string>It's not about loss... Strength is a choice.<lf>Fighting like hell to protect what's important.
<string>You threw away everything you ever had...<lf>No wonder you have no true power!
<string>Danteeeeee!
