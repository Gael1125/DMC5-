<string>STORY
<string>CHARACTER
<string>
<string>Dante, the legendary Devil Hunter. He may be a<lf>legend, but it seems there's at least one demon<lf>who can still match him blow for blow. On a job<lf>for the mysterious V, Nero ventures into the<lf>depths of the underworld to aid Dante and take<lf>down some demons. There's a twinge in his<lf>phantom right arm...it's crying out for a fight.
<string>There was once a demon who saved the human world<lf>from destruction. That demon became a legend, but<lf>with time his name faded from the annals of history.<lf>Now the world faces a new threat. Will the outcome<lf>of this battle be determined by man? By demon?<lf>Or perhaps...
<string>The demon king Urizen's strength was beyond<lf>all expectations. Dante was forced onto the back<lf>foot and yelled at Nero to get out while he still<lf>could. As a strange demonic infestation climbed<lf>ever higher towards the surface, V and Nero fell<lf>back in defeat, unable to do a thing to stop it.<lf>What fate lies in store for Dante, beaten and left<lf>behind?
<string>Events were set in motion back before Urizen<lf>took his throne, when a silent, hooded figure<lf>came to tear off Nero's demonic right arm.<lf>Now, a month later, Nero is back with a brand<lf>new power—his Devil Breakers—to smash his<lf>way through the demon swarms in Red Grave<lf>and reunite with V.
<string>With the city in the grip of a full-scale demon<lf>invasion, Nero found himself battling—and beating—<lf>a gargantuan demon at a church in the infested<lf>city. After meeting up with V, Nero learned that<lf>the infestation can be traced back to a demonic<lf>tree known as the Qliphoth. Looks like the only<lf>way to free the city is to attack the Qliphoth at<lf>its roots.
<string>Nero and V split up to find separate paths to the<lf>Qliphoth, the demonic tree. Nero encountered a<lf>deadly demon wielding light as a weapon. When<lf>defeated, it turned out to contain Lady. Can she<lf>shed some light on the battle with the demon king?<lf>And what is V's true motive?
<string>The demons at V's command made short work of<lf>the great demon parasitizing the roots of the<lf>Qliphoth, but the arrival of a colossal demonic<lf>monstrosity destroyed the road ahead, plunging<lf>V underground.
<string>After dodging the colossal demon above, V made<lf>rapid progress underground, moving towards his<lf>true goal of recovering Sparda.<lf>Meanwhile, back on the surface...
<string>Nero toppled the colossal demon striding<lf>through the ruins of Red Grave. He doesn't<lf>have time for fear; no matter what terrors lurk<lf>in his path, there's only one enemy on his mind.<lf>Nico managed to catch up with him and give<lf>him the good news: Lady's awake.
<string>Judging by Lady's account, there's little chance<lf>that Trish and Dante made it out of the battle<lf>against the demon king unscathed. Nero and V<lf>pressed on through the subway system and finally<lf>reached the roots of the Qliphoth.<lf>The ruins of an old house there prompted<lf>V to share his thoughts...which only deepened<lf>Nero's suspicions. Who or what is V?
<string>With V determined to seek out Sparda, Nero went<lf>his own way and confronted the demon king Urizen<lf>alone. Just when he seemed on the brink of<lf>revenge, Urizen unleashed an unseen level of power<lf>that Nero could not hope to match. All seemed lost<lf>until an unfamiliar demon with blazing red eyes<lf>rushed in and beat back the demon king's assault.
<string>The entire crisis began when V visited Devil May<lf>Cry and hired Dante to take on the demon king<lf>Urizen. Now, V has left Nero's side and discovered<lf>Sparda near its wielder—Dante, who appears to<lf>have been comatose since his battle with Urizen.<lf>With hatred and vengeance in his eyes, V brought<lf>the sword down toward Dante, but as the blade<lf>descended, Dante's eyes flicked open...!
<string>After awakening from a trip through his boyhood<lf>memories, Dante spoke about the first battle with<lf>Urizen. Everything was going well until Trish,<lf>Lady, and Dante made it inside Urizen's fortress<lf>and came under fire from Urizen's terrifying<lf>power. Nero and V joined the fight but were<lf>quickly forced to retreat. And now...
<string>After awakening from a month spent recuperating,<lf>Dante headed for the demon king. He crushed the<lf>demon knight blocking his path and rescued Trish<lf>from within, only to continue making his way<lf>towards the Qliphoth. Meanwhile, V revealed<lf>his past to Trish.
<string>V revealed the truth to Trish—he is in fact one<lf>part of Dante's brother. Vergil used the power<lf>of Yamato to cleave himself in two, separating<lf>his human and demon sides into two distinct<lf>beings. As V recounted the tale, Dante absorbed<lf>Rebellion into himself and awakened his true<lf>power. He battled Urizen and forced him back,<lf>but at that moment the Qliphoth completed its<lf>emergence into the human world.
<string>Qliphoth, blood-drinker, infernal tree. At its<lf>nadir, all the life force it has absorbed is<lf>condensed into an unholy fruit. Dante, Nero,<lf>and V stand together, each for their own reasons,<lf>and prepare for the final battle. They set forth<lf>toward the depths of the Qliphoth, fighting<lf>through the harshest resistance yet. V is grimly<lf>determined; he will see this through to the end.
<string>Time is running out. As his body started to fail<lf>him, V summoned what strength remained to<lf>continue downward. With devilish illusions cast<lf>before him, he was thrown into pocket planes where<lf>he faced shades of the underworld lite, and<lf>though he finally reached the source of his<lf>torment, he had too little strength to defend<lf>himself. But just then, Nero appeared, having<lf>reached this point via a different route...
<string>Revenge is almost within Nero's grasp, and that's<lf>all the motivation he needed to persevere through<lf>a gauntlet of fiendish demons. He took down the<lf>enemies in his path and finally managed to<lf>rendezvous with V, who appeared to be at death's<lf>door. Even so, the man was determined to press on.<lf>Together they continued toward the base of the<lf>Qliphoth. Meanwhile, Dante is even farther<lf>ahead...
<string>Having obtained the power of his Sin Devil Trigger<lf>form, Dante was the first to reach the deepest<lf>depths of the Qliphoth, where he defeated a<lf>demon in a battle reminiscent of a past<lf>encounter, obtaining a new weapon in the<lf>process. Then, at last, he arrived at the final<lf>battleground: the uncanny arena where Urizen<lf>lies in wait.
<string>Urizen ate the fruit of the Qliphoth and gained<lf>power beyond reckoning, but Dante's new strength<lf>proved greater still. The furious battle reached<lf>its climax, with Dante finally bringing the demon<lf>king to his knees. As the life ebbed from the<lf>Urizen, V approached and merged with the fallen<lf>king. Where once stood man and demon...<lf>Vergil was restored.
<string>Dante revealed the truth to Nero: Vergil is his<lf>father. Leaving the younger Devil Hunter in shock,<lf>Dante then went on alone to confront Vergil at the<lf>summit of the Qliphoth. The path was blocked by<lf>V's castoffs, the three demons that served him<lf>until his reunion with Urizen. Having proved<lf>to them what it means to be a legendary Devil<lf>Hunter, all that's left is to confront his brother.
<string>A brotherhood defined by hatred and grudging<lf>respect. A rivalry for the ages. Vergil and Dante<lf>clashed...all their grievances, their enmity, their<lf>reasons to fight, focused into one decisive<lf>battle. But this would not be their end...<lf>Nero, having found his own reasons to fight,<lf>comes between his father and uncle. There<lf>will be no fratricide this day.

<string>V can use his pet demons to escape damage, but<lf>he won't be able to use this strategy when they<lf>are out of action (in stalemate), so be careful.
<string>V's pet demons regain vitality faster when close<lf>to V. When they're in danger, back off the attack<lf>or keep them near V.
<string>During Devil Trigger, Shadow and Griffon will<lf>start attacking enemies automatically. The timer<lf>that appears over their vitality gauges shows how<lf>much longer they'll stay on the attack.
<string>Griffon's dashing Flank Attack will automatically<lf>home in on enemies, striking others en route to the<lf>intended targets.
<string>Griffon's electrifying Double Check skill lasts<lf>for a long time, letting him pile on even more<lf>attacks in the interim.
<string>Summon Shadow near an enemy or in mid-air to have<lf>him attack enemies as he appears.
<string>V's pet demon Nightmare is invincible.<lf>He acts on his own, but summoning him to the battle<lf>will help to clear out the horde.

<string>If a certain location catches your eye, it's worth<lf>taking the time to investigate. Maybe you can find<lf>a hidden stash of Red Orbs! Not every spot will<lf>yield a reward, of course, but don't let that dim<lf>your curiosity.

<string>
<string>Tutorials are for learning the basics.<lf>Even Devil Hunters gotta start somewhere.
<string>Focus your attacks and take out any blood clots<lf>you see. You can also take advantage of their<lf>weakness to fire. Just keep an eye on your<lf>surroundings when attacking and don't forget to<lf>dodge any enemies that come near.
<string>You can knock back the fireballs and other projectiles<lf>that Goliath shoots at you with Gerbera's Jocky<lf>and Overture's Battery attacks. If dodging isn't<lf>your style, try giving the demon a taste of its<lf>own medicine instead.
<string>Attacking Artemis' projectiles will turn them into<lf>Grim Grips that you can then use to your advantage<lf>to strike back.
<string>Two heads are better than one.<lf>Summon Nightmare, split up, and go after<lf>different heads on Nidhogg at once.
<string>There are points you can attack on Gilgamesh's<lf>legs when they pierce through the ceiling,<lf>giving you a chance to collect lots of Red Orbs.
<string>Elder Geryon can manipulate time to stop V or his<lf>pet demons in their tracks, so attacking recklessly<lf>will leave them open to punishment. Keep an eye on<lf>the positions and vitality of each pet demon, and<lf>ensure they can dodge when the time is right.
<string>You aren't going to get anywhere if you stay on<lf>the ground. Attack the weak areas on Gilgamesh's<lf>legs to reveal Snatch points that you can use to<lf>climb up to his head, and his exposed weak point.
<string>The Angelos will come at you tactically. Proto<lf>Angelo is in charge, so taking him out first will<lf>scatter their formation and make it easier to pick<lf>them off one by one.
<string>If you come across a trap or obstacle, take a look<lf>at your surroundings. There might be something<lf>nearby you can use to your advantage.
<string>Urizen's shield can be worn away by attacks,<lf>both yours and his own. Hit it with all you've<lf>got, and with enough time and effort you should<lf>be able to bust through.
<string>It's easy to forget which way you were going after<lf>a battle. Keep your cool and take a moment to look<lf>around—you'll find your way.
<string>Don't be entranced by the bizarre dancing of the<lf>Nobodies. Instead, focus on how their attack<lf>patterns vary. The eyeball attacks from the green-<lf>masked ones stun easily, while the grab attack<lf>from the red-masked ones inflicts brutal damage.
<string>Master style changes to draw out Dante's potential<lf>to the fullest. Chain together fast and furious<lf>techniques to toy around with the demon horde.
<string>The demon tree's roots have spread through the ruins.<lf>Some of the roots run through unstable ground which will open<lf>up to reveal new paths if you destroy the root's weak spots.<lf>You might even come across something valuable.
<string>Don't let Cavaliere Angelo's gigantic sword<lf>intimidate you. Meet blade with blade, and if you<lf>time an attack well enough, you'll knock the<lf>enemy back and leave him open for a counter.<lf>Show him who the real sword master is.
<string>Not sure where to go next? Take a look around.<lf>There's sure to be a hint nearby—breakable<lf>walls, hidden passageways, or even items you<lf>can see in the distance.
<string>A maximum of three people can fight together here.<lf>The battle may get intense, but don't forget why<lf>you're here. Go down the hole in the center of the<lf>room and head for the lower levels.
<string>The pet demons have been imprisoned by the enemy.<lf>The order in which you free the demons will<lf>have a large impact on the battle, so think long and<lf>hard about which pet demon will help you most.
<string>Many traps and enemies await you on your path.<lf>Be sure to plan ahead and choose the best<lf>Devil Breaker for the situation.
<string>When the demon bird Malphas goes on a rampage,<lf>that's your chance to get in close and deal big<lf>damage. It's risky, but it may be worth it.
<string>Your goal is to reach the bottom of the tree.<lf>White Orbs give you more options against the<lf>powerful enemies that block your path. Make sure<lf>the tide of battle stays in your favor.
<string>Each of King Cerberus' heads has a unique<lf>elemental attack. Take out one of the heads to<lf>upset its attack pattern and gain the advantage.
<string>Urizen has a wide range of attacks, but don't let<lf>that throw you off your game. Just stay cool,<lf>study his moves, and attack when the time is<lf>right.
<string>If you see a red blood clot on the roots of the<lf>demon tree, destroy it. This will change certain<lf>areas of the battleground at the upper level where<lf>you fight with the three demons, giving you an<lf>advantage in battle.
<string>In a boss fight against three demons, you'll<lf>have to keep moving if you don't want to be<lf>overwhelmed. Nightmare will keep healing the<lf>other demons, so focus your attacks on him first.
