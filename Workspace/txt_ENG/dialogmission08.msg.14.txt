<string>All right...just you wait, you big bastard.<lf>I'll drag you all the way down here.
<string>Onwards and upwards...
<string>This again... Where's it gonna take me now?
<string>Man... I got blood all over me.<lf>There better be a shower in here.
<string>Are there no express elevators?<lf>Someone's a lousy architect.
<string>Your interior design sucks, dude.<lf>You and your treehouse will be gone soon.
<string>Good, finally made it. Now, about that payback.
<string>Think it's good to be king, huh? Not for much longer.
<string>Where does this go?
<string>It's still falling?
<string>Damn, all the way down. Too heavy, huh?
<string>Out of my way, wimps!
<string>Well, well. Haven't had enough yet?
<string>Never stood a chance.
<string>What the hell? ...This is bad.
<string>A phone, here? Does it still work?
<string>Guess that's my ride.
<string>All right... Going down is the only way, huh?
<string>
<string>You would so readily throw away your life, child?
<string>I'm not interested in you having a winning streak.<lf>Now I can break it for ya.
<string>
<string>Humans...are all so foolish.<lf>Don't you understand that your efforts are futile?
<string>Best thing about humans is that we never give up.<lf>Just watch, I'll beat it into your head!
<string>
<string>Very well... I shall show you my true power.
<string>You were holding back!? Dammit!
<string>Die in the depths of despair!
<string>
<string>It's working! That shield of yours...is done for!
<string>You...!
<string>
<string>It's almost broken! You ready to get slapped!?
<string>You will suffer!
<string>
<string>You shall regret your existence!
<string>You will not overcome me!
<string>You're nothing but a maggot!
<string>You worthless piece of scum!
<string>Run while you can...
<string>Nowhere to go!
<string>Humans... Conceited and useless beings...
<string>
<string>So, think you can make it all the way here?
<string>Duh. Who do you think you're talking to?
<string>
<string>Hate to say it, but I'm running out of arms.
<string>I'll be right there, ya damn klutz.
<string>
<string>I kinda screwed up... Hurry over here.
<string>Boo-hoo. Wait there, and try not to cry.
<string>
<string>
<string>Is this...my limit...?
