<string>Hold <ICON ACT_BtnL> to charge your weapon with more power.<lf>Skillful use of charging during battle can make it<lf>easier to raise your Stylish Rank.
<string>If you start running low on Devil Breakers, try<lf>searching around for more. You might find some on<lf>the street, down alleys, or hidden behind something.<lf>But be warned, enemies in the area are liable to<lf>crush them underfoot, so be sure to grab one as<lf>soon as you see it.
<string>Nico's Devil Breakers are fragile, shattering if<lf>you take a hit while using them. Know when to<lf>use them sparingly and when to go all out.

<string>Devil Breaker: Overture<lf>A user-friendly Devil Breaker with average power.<lf>Can take out puny demons in one hit.
<string>Battery<lf>An Overture skill that allows the user to<lf>fire electricity from the Devil Breaker's palm.<lf>Its effectiveness changes depending on whether the<lf>enemy is airborne, knocked down, or near a wall.

<string>Petal Ray<lf>A Gerbera skill. In mid-air it allows the user to<lf>fire piercing beams. Firing them down narrow<lf>passages will cause them to ricochet violently,<lf>dealing multiple hits to enemies in their path.

<string>If a certain location catches your eye, it's worth<lf>taking the time to investigate. Maybe you can find<lf>a hidden stash of Red Orbs! Not every spot will<lf>yield a reward, of course, but don't let that dim<lf>your curiosity.
