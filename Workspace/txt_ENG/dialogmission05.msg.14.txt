<string>Now to find an exit...
<string>Whoa! What in the world!?
<string>Ahhh, he's throwing a tantrum up there!<lf>Watch the ceiling, V!
<string>Jeez, he almost turned us to paste...<lf>What say we break a leg?
<string>That should make it a little easier for Nero...<lf>Knock on wood.
<string>Bravo, helping out the kid!<lf>Didn't know you had such a big heart!
<string>The kid can handle things up there for now...<lf>Let's work on finding a way topside.
<string>Can't move forward without breaking through these...
<string>This way, I guess.
<string>There must be an escape route...
<string>This ship is awfully big...
<string>A hidden path! Hot damn!
<string>Hey, what's in that hole? Should we take a look?
<string>Woohoo! Finally outside! And look at that, a phone.
<string>
<string>The power to control time... That's quite a horse.
<string>But that would mean it's Geryon!<lf>I thought Dante killed it already!
<string>A rare species, but apparently not quite extinct.<lf>Until today, that is.
<string>
<string>Be careful, V! He's got horsepower!
<string>I'll take that momentum... And send it right back.
<string>
<string>Weak, powerless creatures.
<string>So? You got a comeback for that?
<string>"One thought fills immensity..."
<string>This is not the time for poetry!<lf>Wait, what does that even mean?
<string>Where there's a will, there's a way... Now let's go!
<string>
<string>Hey, I could use a hand.
<string>You got it. Wait right there.
<string>
<string>Nico...
<string>That bad, huh? Be right there.
<string>
<string>.........
<string>Is that you, V? Wait right there.
