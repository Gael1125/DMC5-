<string>I think we should split into two groups.
<string>...And cover more ground. Good idea.
<string>Behold my genius.
<string>Cash first.
<string>All the materials I collected for your<lf>little pet projects don't count for anything?
<string>My brilliant, badass work is worth<lf>every dime, you know it.
<string>Well, your quality control sucks ass, and you know that.
<string>Or maybe don't let the demons smack you around so much?
<string>Whatever...
<string>I am truly gifted. It's a work of art!
<string>So you're an artist now, huh?
<string>Yes I am. Got any questions, little chicken?
<string>My grandmother was called the<lf>".45 Caliber Virtuoso"... Legendary gunsmith.
<string>I hope to be like her someday.<lf>An artist, and a lethal artisan.
<string>Everything I create is art, whether it's a gun...
<string>Or a steel pot...to cook birds in.
<string>Any more questions? Huh?
<string>...Little chickee.
<string>I'll take my leave now.
<string>And if I don't see you along the way,
<string>I'll see you at the bottom of the Qliphoth.
<string>Sure.
<string>What're you gonna do?
<string>I gotta shake the cobwebs out. I'll let you know.
<string>Hey, you got any more questions, better ask it now.
<string>I can't read minds...
<string>Well, yet.
<string>
<string>All right, move out!
<string>So much for teamwork.
<string>
<string>What, no chit-chat or monologue?
<string>Just getting right to the point, huh?
<string>
<string>Dante's friend...
<string>It's Lady.
<string>You know her?
<string>From my gunsmith days.
<string>What?
<string>I can't believe you'd do this to Kyrie.<lf>I'm gonna have to tell her, man...
<string>
<string>I'm jokin'...
<string>Hey, loosen up your jock strap.
<string>Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
<string>Kyrie would kill me right now...
