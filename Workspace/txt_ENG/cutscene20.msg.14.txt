<string>Hello?
<string>Nero? Is that you, Nero?
<string>Did something happen?
<string>Kyrie...
<string>When I was a kid, I...I was alone.
<string>You and Credo were all I knew.
<string>And now all of a sudden, I find out I have a family.
<string>What am I supposed to do with that?
<string>
<string>You always know which path is right, and which is wrong.
<string>There's no need to doubt yourself.
<string>
<string>Thanks...
<string>I guess that's all I needed to hear.
<string>
<string>I have one last thing to take care of...
<string>Then I'm coming home.
<string>
<string>I couldn't protect Credo.
<string>To this day, I hate myself for not having enough strength.
<string>But this time is different.
<string>I swear!
<string>I'M NOT LETTING YOU DIE!
<string>
<string>This is...curious.
<string>Nero?
<string>What form of power is this?
<string>What the hell?
<string>This ends, right here.
<string>Listen to me. I told you already, this is not your—
<string>You listen, dead weight.
<string>I won't let you kill each other.
<string>There are other ways of settling your differences.
<string>I'm putting a stop to this sibling rivalry.
<string>Ahh, you came all this way just for that.
<string>Vergil...V...whatever you call yourself...
<string>Dante's not gonna die here, and neither are you.
<string>Do you have a problem with that?
<string>"Not gonna die," my ass.
<string>That bitch slap nearly killed me.
<string>
<string>If I beat Nero...
<string>Then by default, I beat you. Agreed, Dante?
<string>Whatever. I don't really care.
<string>I'm just gonna sit this one out.
<string>When this is over, I'll make you submit...
<string>Father.
<string>
<string>Interesting...
<string>Oh, brother.
<string>You cut off your own son's arm<lf>for more power, and you still lost.
<string>Enough, dammit!
<string>The underworld is taking over, and we<lf>need to do something before it's too late.
<string>He's right. We need to close that portal.
<string>Hey, you lost, so you better do what he says.
<string>I can still fight.
<string>But if those roots continue to spread through<lf>town, it'll just interfere with our business.
<string>Now, that's the smartest thing I've ever heard you say.
<string>Better hurry up... We still got a score to settle.
<string>Evidently.
<string>Wait, where are you going?
<string>We need to sever the Qliphoth roots<lf>from the underworld itself.
<string>Then, we'll seal the portal with the Yamato.
<string>
<string>Hang on, if you do that, you can't come back.
<string>Why do you think I'm goin'? Somebody's gotta<lf>keep an eye on your old man.
<string>You can't just expect me to stay here while you both go—
<string>It's because you're here we can go. 
<string>We're trusting you with things on this side, capisce?
<string>Make haste, Dante.
<string>Yeah, I know.
<string>Hey, wait!
<string>Take care, Nero. Adios.
<string>I won't lose next time.
<string>Hold onto that until then.
<string>Idiots...
