<string>Never would've guessed you'd come back...<lf>Dammit, V, was this your plan all along?
<string>Something crushed up there...
<string>Great...can't wait for the rematch.
<string>One more round... It's like I'm back on Mallet Island.
<string>Running away? ...Nah, didn't think so.
<string>They know they don't stand a chance...<lf>Are they trying to atone for something?
<string>Now... All that's left is the main dish.
<string>Oops, that doesn't sound good.<lf>...Eh, I'm sure it's fine.
<string>
<string>Come here and face me like a man, boy!
<string>Why the rush? I'm enjoyin' this!
<string>
<string>Ya can't kill what's already dead...<lf>And a demon is a demon, even in death!
<string>Not a bad line... I feel the same way.
<string>
<string>Bring it on! This is a graveâ€”either yours, or ours!
<string>Not the worst place to die...<lf>But death's not on my agenda just yet!
<string>
<string>This is the climax! If you've got any regrets, voice 'em<lf>now before we shut your stupid mouth for good!
<string>I'm too young for regrets... Now, let's end this!
<string>
<string>All right, let's get started! This'll be quite the party!
<string>Damn... You're as tough as you look!
<string>Time out! Gimme some time out!
<string>Hey! Watch the birdie, Dante!
<string>Even that couldn't stop ya!? You ain't so bad!
<string>You'll take care of the rest...
<string>It's not over yet...
<string>
<string>Welcome to your Nightmare!
<string>Sweet dreams!
<string>It all ends now with this!
<string>Good, good! Now you're talking!
<string>I'm not done yet!
<string>Sorry pal, we don't know when to stop. Get used to it.
<string>I'm going to kill you! I'll kill you, Dante!
<string>Ahh, reminiscence of a time long past!
<string>I won't...let you go to Vergil!
<string>What a mess!
<string>Just close your eyes and go to sleep...forever!
<string>Not bad, but I'm just getting started!
