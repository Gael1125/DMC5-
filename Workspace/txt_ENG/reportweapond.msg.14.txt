<string>The sword left to Dante by his<lf>legendary demon daddy, the<lf>Dark Knight Sparda.<lf><lf>I've been slacking off on my<lf>devil sword studies, so I<lf>can't say much, but it ain't no<lf>normal weapon, that's for sure.<lf><lf>I mean, that Yamato sword you had<lf>ganked from you has the power to<lf>separate man from demon, right?<lf>I bet this sword has some crazy<lf>powers of its own, too. But as<lf>things stand, I can't quite figure<lf>out what they might be.
<string>The sword Sparda bears more<lf>than the Dark Knight's name:<lf>it gives off an ominous,<lf>but somehow divine, power.<lf><lf>I hear the thing's brimming with<lf>demonic power, but only a few<lf>tough hombres can actually<lf>wield the dang thing.<lf><lf>I'd love to spend some quality<lf>time experimenting on this<lf>blade...but naw, better not.<lf>I'd only get chewed out.
<string>A new devil sword born from the<lf>fusion of Rebellion and Sparda:<lf>the devil sword Dante.<lf><lf>Looks like Dante's following in<lf>his daddy's footsteps, swinging<lf>around a demon blade with his<lf>own name.<lf><lf>I dunno if he used his own power<lf>to fuse it with Sparda, or if it was<lf>Rebellion's doing...<lf>Either way, anyone can see this<lf>is one hell of a new weapon.
<string>There's an area in the underworld<lf>called Fire Hell, once ruled over<lf>by a big nasty beast named<lf>Berial. After he bit the dust,<lf>they say this even bigger<lf>badass, Balrog, inherited the<lf>burning throne.<lf><lf>Bad luck for him, he ran into our<lf>boy Dante, who whooped him like<lf>a rented mule and added his power<lf>to his collection of Devil Arms.<lf><lf>The way this thing builds up heat<lf>to unleash powerful attacksâ€”<lf>there's no doubt this is the<lf>power of the king of flames.<lf>Anyone else would burn to a<lf>crisp wielding this beast,<lf>but Dante's a seasoned vet'<lf>when it comes to handling<lf>hot stuff.
<string>I gotta tell ya, of all Dante's<lf>Devil Arms, this one really<lf>butters my biscuit.<lf><lf>This is what happens when you<lf>jam together a bunch of demonic<lf>armor with a broken down hog.<lf>I tell ya, I tried digging around<lf>under the hood myself, but I<lf>still have no dang clue how this<lf>thing works.<lf><lf>Hell, I even asked the man<lf>himself about it, but even<lf>Dante couldn't explain how he<lf>threw this friggin' freak show<lf>together.<lf><lf>I mean come on, a chopper<lf>turned into a sword!? Heh, makes<lf>the Red Queen look like standard<lf>issue.
<string>Dante used to have a Devil Arm<lf>called Cerberus way back when.<lf>If Dante went and turned that one<lf>in for an upgrade, this's what<lf>he'd end up with.<lf><lf>The so-called king of the Cerberus<lf>clan wasn't just whistling Dixie,<lf>let me tell ya. This arm changes<lf>shape, releasing fire, ice, even<lf>lightning as it tears through<lf>everything in its path.<lf><lf>As a craftsman, I'm pretty keen to<lf>figure out how you could cram all<lf>of those powers into this one slick<lf>weapon.
<string>A pair of gorgeous pistols made<lf>by Nell Goldstein, gunsmith and<lf>grandma to an equally gorgeous<lf>granddaughter.<lf><lf>At first you might think the only<lf>difference between the two is<lf>their color, but you'd be wrong.<lf>Ebony's all about accuracy, while<lf>Ivory's tweaked for rapid fire.<lf><lf>If I had the chance I'd disassemble<lf>the pair and see what makes<lf>them tick, but now's not the time<lf>for that.<lf><lf>Still, what an artist grandma<lf>was. Can't help but be proud.
<string>Dante modded this shotgun into<lf>an anti-demon weapon.<lf><lf>Compared to the sheer beauty of<lf>my grandma's guns, this thing's<lf>barbaric! Have you SEEN what this<lf>thing is like inside!?<lf>It's like blowing up a dam to put<lf>out a campfire.<lf><lf>Don't get me wrong, I could make<lf>something just as gnarly...and<lf>pretty to look at, to boot. Doubt<lf>Dante would gave two shakes about<lf>that, though.
<string>I built this here Devil Arm based<lf>off Daddy's old research. Got the<lf>name Faust from the demon I based<lf>this design concept off of.<lf><lf>It fires crystallized demon blood<lf>like bullets...y'know, Red Orbs?<lf>I also made sure it causes any<lf>demon it hits to cough up a butt-<lf>load of blood.<lf><lf>Amazing, ain't it!? You'd have to<lf>be a few beers short of a six-<lf>pack to pass up a Devil Arm<lf>like this.
<string>A multipurpose missile launcher,<lf>and Lady's bosom buddy. She named<lf>it after her dear departed momma.<lf><lf>It was designed and built by some<lf>other craftsman, but after they<lf>passed away I've been the one she<lf>comes to for tune-ups. Believe you<lf>me, she's real attached to this<lf>thing.<lf><lf>Whoever made this, I can tell they<lf>knew what they were doing, and<lf>then some. Sure wish I'd gotten<lf>the chance to meet 'em.
<string>A replica of Lady's Kalina Ann<lf>I fashioned from memory.<lf><lf>Don't let the "II" fool you, it's<lf>not an upgrade on the original.<lf>I made sure it didn't stray too<lf>far from the source material.<lf><lf>Still, this IS me we're talking<lf>about here...so I added a fun little<lf>something extra for when the<lf>original Kalina Ann surfaces.<lf>Might be a bit much for Lady...<lf>But Dante? Heh heh...
<string>HA! I knew Dante had it in 'im!<lf>He found the Kalina Ann and<lf>brought it back!<lf><lf>Now that coupling mechanism I<lf>hid in my Kalina Ann II won't go<lf>to waste...I bet you can guess<lf>what that's for now?<lf><lf>BOOM! Throw the two Kalina Anns<lf>together to discharge an insanely<lf>high-powered heat ray!<lf><lf>Still, a girl needs her secrets,<lf>right? So, uh...don't tell Lady<lf>about this, m'kay?
