<string>Our last hope, Nero...
<string>was completely useless.
<string>
<string>V, get Nero out of here! This was a bad move!
<string>
<string>Nero, go! You're just dead weight.
<string>That bastard called me dead weight!<lf>I didn't come all this way for nothing!
<string>
<string>This...is power.
<string>The devil sword Sparda no longer serves a purpose.
<string>I have plans for the both of you.
<string>You will exist to give me strength.
<string><lf>How fortunate to serve such divine purpose.
<string>
<string>All right, enough's enough.
<string>Can't let a boy...
<string>do a man's job.
<string>Hey, wait! I'm not done talking yet—
<string>Okay, you get some rest.
<string>By the way...I guess I owe you one.
<string>
<string>Is it Halloween already?
<string>Sparda...!
<string>That costume looks a little big...<lf>I thought you had better taste than that.
<string>How about I take it in a little?
<string>
<string>Whoa, looks like I took in a little too much.
<string>You okay?
<string>I've been better.
<string>Dante...that demon is—!
<string>Don't even think about it. Just rest.
<string>Dante!
<string>Take care of Trish for me!
<string>Dante, wait—!
<string>Dante's left...
<string>Yes...
<string>And I don't think he can win.
<string>What was that demon, V? Where did it come from?
<string>Urizen is not a demon. I know that for a fact<lf>because I'm from the underworld.
<string>My God, what are you, then?
<string>It doesn't matter. I'm a shadow<lf>of my former self who lost everything.
<string>I will tell you the story of my birth.
