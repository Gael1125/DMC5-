<string>In light of this incident, the government has now—
<string>They're demons! I've seen them with my own eyes!
<string>Red Grave is completely taken over!
<string>Let us pray for mercy. This is a trial<lf>from the heavens above... The end—
<string>
<string>Same crap, different day.
<string>So, tell me.
<string>Tell you what?
<string>How's it feel to be rescuing the guy<lf>that killed your father?
<string>Hey, I'm glad we're gettin' personal.
<string>Well, he abandoned my mother and I and left us for dead...
<string>So, I feel nothin'.
<string>Well he's not exactly going up for a<lf>Father of the Year award, now is he?
<string>His research wasn't half bad. Came in handy.
