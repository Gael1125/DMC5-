<string>What're you, lonely? Hurry up and get moving!
<string>Sorry, but I need alone time. Get going, crybaby!
<string>
<string>What a mess...
<string>Not making it easy for me, huh?
<string>Trying to stop me? Oh, whatever shall I do?
<string>Huh... Yeah, I can make this work.
<string>Shoulda just hacked my way through.
<string>This again...?
<string>Oh man... I'm getting sick of this.
<string>That was the floor's fault, not mine.
<string>I'm getting really sick of this stupid tree...
<string>Exit's gotta be around here somewhere.
<string>I should get rolling.
<string>Wait... Which way did I come from again?
<string>Still no V, huh?
<string>Oh nice, loot. I'll take that.
<string>What are demons doing in a city like this...?<lf>There something to this place?
<string>V doesn't seem like a demon to me...
<string>Not gonna lie...this new arm is pretty sweet.
<string>
<string>Now THERE's a big one...

<string>Don't forget to set your Devil Breaker before you leave.
<string>I need to catch up to V, fast.
<string>
<string>You'll be sorry for this!
<string>Yeah, maybe I will. Sorry I'm about to kill ya!

<string>

<string>It's your grave... Jack it up all you want.
<string>The next thing to shatter will be your bones!
<string>
<string>You're eating garbage now? You got some weird tastes.
<string>You mock me, you die!
<string>
<string>H-how could a mere human do this!?
<string>Says a mere demon... How about we wrap this up?
<string>Damn you!
<string>
<string>Eat dirt, you scum!
<string>Heed my power!
<string>Is that all, you puny human?
<string>Death upon you!
<string>The fruit is mine!
<string>Stop buzzing around!
<string>
<string>Guess the phone still works...
