<string>So, V. You think this kid can kill Urizen?
<string>
<string>One can only hope.
<string>But for now, we have a more...pressing engagement.
<string>
<string>Oooh, genius, says "be careful." Yeah, no shit, Shirley!<lf>Ain't that right, V?
<string>
<string>I mean, you ARE fragile at the moment. Wouldn't<lf>take much to wipe you out in a sticky situation.
<string>
<string>I'm just saying running away is okay. It's always<lf>okay to run away, if you're not up for it!
<string>
<string>"He who desires but act not, breeds pestilence."
<string>...So it is written.
<string>Okay Shakespeare. Just remember this:
<string>You and I like to exist.
<string>So get rid of those demons quick,<lf>'cause killin' them ain't my shtick!
<string>I got your back, 'cause dying is whack!
<string>
<string>You dodged me!
<string>Did you dodge me!?
<string>Nidhogg, I never liked this guy.
<string>You pest. Do I know you?
<string>Dumb as a box of rocks.<lf>Let's not even mess with this guy, V.
<string>He can't even leave the Qliphoth, anyway.<lf>Just a Qliphoth parasite.
<string>Did you insult me?
<string>— Uh-oh.
<string>― You insulted me!
<string>I think he heard me...and he's angry!
<string>I'm going to kill you!
<string>Not in this lifetime.
<string>"As the air to a bird, or the sea to a fish,"
<string>"so is contempt to the contemptible."
<string>
<string>Okay, um, all right that's not good at all.
<string>That's not good.
<string>Wait, where—where are you going?<lf>Are you running away?
<string>That, that's not a good sign.
<string>I'm afraid that...that's a little bit more<lf>than I can take on right now.
