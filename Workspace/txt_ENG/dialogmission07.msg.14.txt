<string>You can follow if you want, but I'm going ahead.
<string>A dead end.
<string>This WAS the right way! Nailed it.
<string>Gotta push on ahead.
<string>Okay... Guess I'm goin' down.
<string>Welcome to the party, partner! You ready to dance?
<string>Can Nico even make it out here?
<string>What a warm welcome! How sweet.
<string>What's wrong, V? Why the long face?
<string>Ahh, don't mind him, he's just being moody!
<string>It's just that the armored bastard<lf>reminds him of an old friend of his!
<string>Sounds like a hell of a guy...<lf>I'd like to meet him someday.
<string>Better to split up... We can cover more ground.
<string>It's a fucking maze in here...<lf>But we still gotta search every corner!
<string>Indeed.
<string>Careful, V... Something in here stinks.
<string>This way.
<string>Beee-yootiful! NOW it's a party!
<string>The Qliphoth has grown this large...<lf>How much blood has been sacrificed?
<string>Hey, how's it goin'?
<string>...Can't complain.
<string>Still alive, kid? You're a tough one, huh!?
<string>Zip it up, will ya? 'Less you wanna<lf>end up in a frying pan.
<string>...Apparently so.
<string>
<string>Irritating creatures!
<string>So aggro... That's not like you...<lf>This another one of your old friends?
<string>Let's just get this over with.
<string>All right.
<string>
<string>Hey, hey, we're working our tail feathers off over here!<lf>Stop slacking off, kid!
<string>Apparently they're not fond of loud-mouthed critters,<lf>either. Maybe you should try shutting up?
<string>
<string>Oh, they just love me! What'd I ever do to them?
<string>Draw their focus for a while. We'll kill them one by one.
<string>
<string>Bored? I've got a job for you.
<string>All right let's hear it, what you got?
<string>
<string>Uh, Nico?
<string>Spit it out. Whattaya want?
<string>
<string>I need you to get over here.
<string>You, in a twist? Wow, did hell just freeze over?
<string>
<string>Can you meet me over here?
<string>Help has arrived! Got any cash?
<string>
<string>...You're up.
<string>Okay. What're we doin'?
<string>
<string>Need you to double-time it.
<string>I took the express, just for you!
