<string>Suffering defeat after defeat, that man's body<lf>was reaching its limit. Breaking down.
<string>But he couldn't die yet. The man had a job that must be done:
<string>To defeat his twin brother.
<string>Dante...
<string>"...heavy chain, that does freeze my bones around!"
<string>In order to defeat his younger brother, he could only do<lf>one thing with the crumbling flesh and feelings.
<string>He needed to separate man from devil<lf>with the strength of the Yamato.
<string>And eventually, the man became a true devil.
<string>
<string>I've tried to hold together my crumbling flesh<lf>with what little demonic power I have left, but...
<string>I'm approaching my limit.
<string>In separating and regaining my human soul,<lf>I've realized the gravity of the crime I've committed.
<string>I've realized how important everything was...<lf>Everything I've thrown away in my pursuit of power.
<string>Is that why you went to find Dante?
<string>Yes. Foolish. 
<string>I thought maybe he could change my...maybe fix...
<string>Maybe right my wrong.
<string>Tell me...
<string>Was this fool before you right?
<string>I'm not your mommy, V.
<string>You're a big boy.
<string>And you need to see this through.
<string>Dante's war.
<string>
<string>How's that for road rash?
<string>
<string>There you are!
<string>Hey, what's wrong with you?
<string>Hey!
<string>Hey, Dante!
<string>The demonic power was activated in me once<lf>when Vergil lovingly jammed this through my chest.
<string>
<string>I always wondered...
<string>Why did my father give me the Rebellion?
<string>Okay, what are you muttering?
<string>Over the years, I've been stabbed and jabbed<lf>by a number of things. But who would've ever guessed...
<string>Have you lost your mind!?<lf>There's a demon to destroy!
<string>Kill yourself later! I'll help!
<string>If the Yamato can separate man from devil...<lf>Then what about the Rebellion?
<string>Wow...
<string>You are...absorbing the Sparda!
<string>
<string>It can't be?
<string>Dante, you son of a bitch...
<string>I knew you couldn't be killed that easily!
<string>Hey, he's all yours.
<string>But don't let it become a habit.
<string>Win, Dante, win!
<string>Dante...
<string>
<string>All this time, and you still don't get it.
<string>It is YOU who does not understand.
<string>It has begun.
<string>
<string>What's happening!?
<string>Bad news! Gotta go now, that house plant is pissed off!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>The Qliphoth is revealed in its entirety.
<string>This inconvenience...
<string>matters not.
