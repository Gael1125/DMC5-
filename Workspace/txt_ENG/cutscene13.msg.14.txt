<string>Well, looks like no one's worse for wear.
<string>I'm just gonna double-check.
<string>Hey, where did that garbage god go? What is Urizen after?
<string>He's at the top of the Qliphoth.
<string>It's the other way around, Dante.
<string>This is the lowest level of the Qliphoth's upper echelon.
<string>
<string>Human blood is the source of demons' power.
<string>The fruit born through the Qliphoth is even more dense<lf>than the blood that created it.
<string>Its power is unparalleled.
<string>Even the almighty Mundus used it<lf>to become the king of the underworld.
<string>V told me everything.
<string>Yeah, well, that's a lovely story and all,<lf>but...as long as we know where to find him.
<string>Whoa! You...are the infamous Dante!
<string>Um, I'm Nicoletta Goldstein. 
<string>Sound familiar?
<string>My grandmother is Nell Goldstein...
<string>The gunsmith that made all your<lf>fancy weapons that you got...
<string>strapped...back there...
<string>
<string>Yeah, there she is!
<string>You don't much look like her...
<string>Yeah, I got my looks from my Daddy.<lf>That's about all I got from him.<lf>
<string>But based on his research, I-I-I managed to cobble this—
<string>Um...it—it—
<string>
<string>Consider it a gift! In honor of us finally meeting!<lf>
<string>Meeting.
<string>I'll take that.
<string>Dante!
<string>I'm gonna go, too.
<string>Why don't you sit this one out?
<string>Oh, let you call me dead weight again? No thanks.
<string>I've got all the power I need. Right here.
<string>You don't understand. It's not what I mean—
<string>
<string>Let him go, Dante.
<string>Time is a luxury that we can no longer afford.
<string>We must chase after him, post-haste.
<string>
<string>What, does that mean you're going, too?
<string>I have a duty to see this through.
<string>Well that's all you had to say, Mr. Poetry.
<string>I'm gonna go my way, and you guys can go yours.
<string>Let's just say that's the best for the cause.
<string>
<string>
<string>Looks like we still got a long ways to go.
