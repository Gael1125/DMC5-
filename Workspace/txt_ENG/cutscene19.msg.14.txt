<string>Hey Vergil, your portal-opening days are over.
<string>Give me the Yamato.
<string>If you want it, then you'll have to take it.
<string>But you already knew that.
<string>I had a feeling you'd say that...
<string>How many times have we fought?
<string>Hard to say.
<string>It's the only memory I have of us since we were kids.
<string>Time to finish this, Vergil!
<string>Once and for all.
<string>
<string>Nero is my son?
<string>Yeah, dumbass.
<string>You can't remember through that thick skull of yours?
<string>Well, well... That was a long time ago.
<string>I guess you were young once, too.
<string>As much as I'd love to hear that story,<lf>I think it's about time we...
<string>...ended this.
<string>
