<string>It's coming from the Qliphoth's root.
<string>Hey, you lost? Get it together, buddy!
<string>Oh no, oh no! What do we do, V!?
<string>I think you better split! You can't take much more!
<string>I've got a bad feeling about this place...<lf>But I think it might get us where we need to go.
<string>Almost there... You gonna make it, V?
<string>Hey look, V, a phone! Check and see if it still works!
<string>Impressive.
<string>This presence...it's the devil sword Sparda!<lf>No doubt about it.
<string>Awwww you miss your mommy? You need a hug?
<string>I've never seen him before...<lf>What's with all the S&M gear?
<string>If we had the devil sword Sparda...<lf>Nero might just be able to defeat him.
<string>Do you think Dante's dead?
<string>Quite possibly. He has no reason to keep Dante alive.
<string>You're awfully quiet, V. Thinking about mommy dearest?
<string>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.<lf>But the past is...a bitter place for me.
<string>Yeeaaaah! That felt good!
<string>Descend it is...
<string>
<string>Its mask changed...?
<string>So that's your tactic? I'll be sure to watch out for that.
<string>
<string>Ugh, what's with that creepy dance!?<lf>I'm losing the will to fly...
<string>It's an eyesore. I'd rather not see it a second time.
<string>Agreed! Finish 'em off before they can bust any more moves!
<string>
<string>It's my turn to play with the devil sword.
<string>Devâ€”! De, de, devvvvvv!
<string>Well, that pissed it off. Eww, still creepy.
<string>
<string>
<string>All right, Missy, you're up!
<string>Keep squawking, little chickee.
<string>
<string>
<string>What's the password?
<string>Hell if I know! Just get over here!
