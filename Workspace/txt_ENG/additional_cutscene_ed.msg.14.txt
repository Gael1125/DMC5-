<string>Adios.
<string>Wow, this thing got real big...
<string>You tryin' to compensate for something?
<string>Yes. Your incompetence.
<string>By the way, how'd it feel catching up with your kid?
<string>There's no need for us to "catch up."
<string>Well, with an attitude like that, you're never gonna meet your grandkids.
<string>That's enough.
<string>I don't want to hear it.
<string>Now, don't get in my way.
<string>Took the words right out of my mouth...!
<string>
<string>That's it. Time to die!
<string>You're like an open book...<lf>I can read your every move
<string>Too easy!
<string>
<string>
<string>Why you gotta leave me hangin'!?<lf>We used to love saying that.
<string>I have no recollection.
<string>Well lemme jog your memory.
<string>A little Vergil...
<string>crying in the corner because mommy got mad?
<string>I seem to recall YOU crying every time father raised his voice.
<string>Hah! How would they feel if they saw us now?
<string>What does it matter?<lf>We're still here aren't we?
<string>Yeah, you're probably right.
