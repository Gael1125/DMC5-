<string>So what happened to him? And Trish? They end up like you?
<string>Trish, she... She was captured. I remember that.
<string>But I don't know what happened to Dante.
<string>Dammit.
<string>You can't travel through here in a car.
<string>Yeah, we know. We're just waitin' on you.
<string>There's only one way up that tree.<lf>Hang on, I'll get ready.
<string>
<string>I'm glad to see you look so well.
<string>You too, I guess...
<string>I found these. If they're of any use to you, they're yours.
<string>Wow! I can make something truly awesome out of this.
<string>Shocker... Can we trust him?
<string>Your guess is as good as mine. He might be useful, though.
<string>Enough talking, get some rest. You need it.
<string>
<string>Yo, Lady, wake up!
<string>It's time to get to work.
<string>I was just told to get some rest.
<string>Aww, you were just told to get some rest?<lf>Well we need to make a path, so start digging.
<string>
<string>— C'mon, get up, get up, get up!
<string>— Okay...
<string>Got something to wear that's good for digging?
<string>
<string>Nice, getting the band back together, huh?
<string>What evil lurks...
<string>I must destroy.
<string>I thought that was the plan all along.
<string>
<string>Took us long enough to get here.
<string>What, tired already?
<string>I've just remembered something...<lf>This town was attacked once before.
<string>
<string>Is that so?
<string>I was here... I can still see it.
<string>In fact, I was playing right here.
<string>That was the house.
<string>This is where we part ways. You go ahead.
<string>You're gonna miss all the fun.
<string>No, I must seek out the devil sword Sparda.
<string>What?
<string>Yeah, I don't think that's such a good idea, trust me.
<string>You're not the only one who thinks so.
<string>But to win this fight, we're going to need<lf>all the help we can get.
<string>Not the only one? 
<string>What the hell aren't you telling me?
