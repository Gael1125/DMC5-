<string>We're alive, we made it!
<string>It's our lucky day, V! Let's go find a game of cards.
<string>These Qliphoth roots... They're everywhere.
<string>Well, we ARE underground.
<string>Then I guess we have some clearing up to do.
<string>And me without my garden shears.
<string>
<string>Malphas... Of course, more trouble.
<string>Not sure about that one, though.<lf>Never seen him before―
<string>―not in the Underworld, anyway!?
<string>Search for the devil sword Sparda. You know where it is...
<string>He told me to leave it be,<lf>but I'm afraid it still concerns me.
<string>As long as there is a blood descendant of Sparda...
<string>I cannot take any chances.
<string>Do you understand!? 
<string>Find it, and destroy it!
<string>Only then will his reign be truly realized!
<string>I see. I know what you are.
<string>Don't worry,
<string>I'll be gentle.
<string>
<string>V!
<string>I'm fine... 
<string>I must chase him.
<string>If the devil sword Sparda still exists,<lf>it may very well be our only hope.
<string>V, uhhh, think about this for a minute now.<lf>What will you do if you find it?
<string>
<string>You gotta be strong in mind and body to<lf>wield the Sparda, and you, sir, are neither.
<string>Hate to break it to you, but the Sparda<lf>will just be too much for ya.
<string>For me, yes. But what of the boy...
<string>Nero?
<string>Let's go.
<string>Once we are near the Sparda, even I<lf>should be able to sense its presence.
