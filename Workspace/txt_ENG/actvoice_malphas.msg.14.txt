<string>Have mercy on my soul!
<string>
<string>What kind of power is it!?
<string>Such a splendid offering.
<string>What are you looking for? Here, I'm over here!
<string>You're still too immature to defeat my master.
<string>Look at you! Crawling on the ground is your best move.
<string>Behold, the one and only power of the underground!
<string>What's the matter? Are you afraid?
<string>Futile attempt.
<string>You try in vain.
<string>What a fool.
<string>Now die!
<string>You will wake in Hell!
